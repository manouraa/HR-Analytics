## Problem Statement

The current Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard aims to provide HR professionals with insights into employee data for enhanced understanding and strategic decision-making. The dashboard captures and presents crucial metrics that could significantly contribute to employee engagement, satisfaction, and overall organizational performance. This dashboard gives HR professionals an overview of the company, its employees, and every department.

Since, the number of employees = 1470 (1233 employees still in the company (Active employees), 237 left the company (inactive employees)), 961 in the technology department (828 active, 133 inactive), 446 in the sales department (354 active, 92 inactive), 63 in HR department (51 active, 12 inactive)

Also the average salary = 112.96 K, average environment satisfaction = 3.87, average relationship satisfaction = 3.43, and average work-life balance = 3.41.
